      <p class="muted">
        I’m an Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics graduate from Texas State University 
        with hands-on experience in hardware systems, signal analysis, and embedded development through 
        project-based and research work. I’m motivated by design-driven engineering problems and enjoy 
        using creative problem solving to optimize performance, reliability, and efficiency in complex systems.

      <h2 class="h2">Experience</h2>
      <p>
        My experience includes working with IMUs, time-of-flight sensors, pulsed coherent radar (PCR), and environmental sensors, supporting both hardware integration and software-side data processing. 
        This includes a Space Lab project involving the design and validation of a scatter detector chamber and custom PCB to measure CO₂ concentration in ambient air, integrated into a high-altitude balloon 
        (HAB) system and developed under strict power, mass, and environmental constraints.
      </p>
        I also completed a semester-long research project on Fourier series, focused on signal decomposition and frequency-domain behavior in physical measurement systems, strengthening my foundation in applied signal processing.
      </p>
        As part of my capstone project, I worked on a multi-sensor system focused on long-term monitoring of small shifts in a home’s foundation, with an emphasis on data reliability through system integration, 
        testing, and analysis. I also served in a project leadership role, coordinating testing efforts, documentation, and cross-subsystem communication across a multi-disciplinary team.
      </p>
        In addition, I’ve applied machine learning techniques in Python to IMU and PCR signal processing tasks, supporting feature extraction, noise characterization, and data-driven analysis alongside traditional filtering methods.
